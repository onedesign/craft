# These are TODO items to make our Craft starter kit better

* Configure mailer settings from ENV vars, https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/config/#mailer-component. Doing this, we can easily configure SMTP email settings for each environment, and we don't need to set these values via the Craft CP.

* Configure volumes in a config file, https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/config/#overriding-volume-settings. Note, these also need to be created manually in the CP even when configured in a config file.
